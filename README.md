# Fitness Center Web App

## Overview

This web application was developed to address overcrowding and simplify the registration process for a fitness center at Vilhelm Kiers Kollegiet. The system provides real-time occupancy updates and streamlines new member registration, making it easier for both users and administrators to manage gym access.

## Features

- **Live Occupancy Tracking**  
  Displays the number of people in the gym in real-time, helping users decide the best time to work out.  

- **User-Friendly Registration**  
  New members can sign up through the web interface, reducing the administrative workload for the fitness board.  

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Fitness administrators can approve new member registrations and manage gym access efficiently.  

- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**  
  The web app is designed for easy use on smartphones, allowing users to check gym status from anywhere.  

## Development Process

This project was developed using an agile approach with iterative **sprints** and **user-centered design**.  

- **Sprint-Based Development**  
  The project was divided into multiple sprints, each lasting two weeks. This ensured continuous evaluation and iteration based on user feedback.  

- **User-Centered Design**  
  - Initial research included field studies, interviews, and observations of gym users and administrators.  
  - A **future workshop** was conducted to understand user needs and define key problems.  
  - Early prototypes were tested with users to refine the system before implementation.  

- **Testing & Evaluation**  
  - **Cognitive Walkthrough:** Internal evaluation to refine usability and interface design.  
  - **Think-Aloud Testing:** Users provided real-time feedback while interacting with the prototype.  
  - **Scenario-Based Evaluation:** Ensured that the system met both user and administrative needs.  

## Future Work

- **Automated Membership Management**  
  Implementing features to allow members to renew or cancel their memberships online.  

- **Notification System**  
  Sending alerts when the gym reaches maximum capacity or when occupancy decreases.  

- **Expanded Fitness Data**  
  Providing historical usage trends to help users plan workouts at less busy times.  

This project successfully enhances gym accessibility and user experience while reducing administrative workload. The fitness board has expressed interest in further development and continued use of the system.
